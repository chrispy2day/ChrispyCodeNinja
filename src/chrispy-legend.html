      <p>
        Hi all, my name is Chris Plowman, AKA Chrispy. 
        I&apos;ve been working in software development for my whole adult life (and far too much of my youth!) 
        starting as a dev and advancing through the ranks as a senior dev, team leader, and architect. 
        For much of my career, I worked as a one-man team which was both a blessing and a curse. 
        It forced me to be able to truly be a full-stack developer and be comfortable with a wide range of technologies. 
        However, as you can imagine it was a lot of pressure as a young developer implementing 
        mission critical software that was directly responsible for millions in revenue. 
        It made me obsessive about researching, seeking out best practices, and constantly 
        improving my abilities, as much for my client as for myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve been fortunate to work on a wide array of projects including data warehousing and 
        analytics, reporting, SharePoint, backend systems, and even some custom medical solutions. 
        However, the bulk of my experience is in web and mobile app development. 
        For web, this started in the Microsoft stack, but is now more and more JS frameworks with 
        a service layer. On the mobile side, I&apos;m a huge fan of Xamarin and have been using 
        it since the MonoTouch days. I&apos;m also a Xamarin Certified developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is my attempt to share the things that I&apos;ve learned over 15+ years as professional 
        developer and get feedback, new ideas, and alternative approaches from all of you. We&apos;re 
        a community and through our discussions, we all improve. So welcome, and I look forward to 
        learning from you and hopefully educating you some too!
