So just over a month ago I renewed my Xamarin certification and I’m finally finding some time to put my experience down for the benefit and possibly humor of others.  Let’s set the stage…

I was in Indiana visiting with family and lending some support for my grandma who was about to go in for back surgery.  I had decided that while I was there and had some downtime from work, it would be the perfect time to knock out my Xamarin certification.  The certification that I had gotten from Evolve 2013 was about to expire and I had already taken all the required courses, so I just needed to sit for the actual exam.

One day it so happened that I was going to have a few hours to myself while the rest of the family had some errands to run.  It was the perfect opportunity so as soon as they left I did a quick review of the coursework and started in on the exam, all 150 questions and 3 hours of it.  I had some experience with Xamarin before the classes and felt I had a pretty strong knowledge of everything that we’d covered, so I was sure I would finish well before the time.

My strategy going in was to do a quick first pass of the exam, knocking out all the super easy questions and then settle in and work through all the remaining items that required actual brain power.  The first question came up and since I didn’t immediately know the answer, I skipped it.  Then the second, same thing.  Third.  Forth.  Fifth.  Holy crap, did I suddenly become a moron?!  I re-read the question I was on.  Nope.  These questions really are tough!  Ok, my approach is going down in a flaming ball of ruin…

Pause.  Ok, self, looks like this isn’t going to be the walk in the park I had expected.  Regroup and let’s shake the cobwebs off that old brain.

Return to question 1.  Read, think, eliminate options, answer, continue.  On and on.  I had some water, I had eaten breakfast — all would be fine.  And it was for the next hour and half or so.  I had gotten through a little more than half the test in half the time.  It was looking like I would be able to finish with some time to spare, but not with the hour or more I had expected.  I had to take a short break to pee and grab a handful of nuts to eat, hoping that would ease the pit in my stomach.

Back to the test and things went ok for the next 30 minutes or so, but the pit in my stomach was growing more restless and unpleasant.  And then, suddenly, my stomach cramped and I made a beeline to the bathroom.  Apparently either something from breakfast had not agreed with me, or the nerves from this gnarly test were eating a hole in my stomach. Not nice!!  Fortunately, after about 15 minutes I was ready to return to my test.  I’d probably lost my buffer, but I should still be able to finish in time easily enough.

…and then I flushed the toilet.

And, of course, it started filling up rather than going down.

(Insert your preferred expletive here…)

Now clogged toilets always suck, but at least at home you know where everything is.  At grandma’s house, I had no clue where the plunger might be.  Fortunately, just then she got home and told me where her plunger was.  It wasn’t too much of a job, but I’d still probably blown another 10 minutes getting the toilet unclogged, not to mention that’s something of a break to your concentration.  At least it didn’t overflow completely, disgusting!

I rushed back to my laptop and the exam.  I had just under 30 minutes left and around 50 questions.  I tried to calm down, I didn’t have the time to be rattled and make careless mistakes.  So I worked as quickly as I could while still being fairly certain of my answers. The last 10 questions were pretty much full sprint, but I finished.

Time was up.  Moment of truth.  Submit.

Phew!  That was the minimum score that I wanted, but at least I had passed and with the ordeal it had been, I was plenty happy with that.

So to any of you who might be looking to take your certification, let me recommend that you take it seriously.  It’s hard!  Also, all that additional reading from the courses — read it.  There were plenty of things on the test that weren’t directly covered in the courses and were in that additional material.  Make sure you’ve planned your meals and have some water available because 3 hours is a long time.  And of course, know where the plunger is ahead of time!  ;)
