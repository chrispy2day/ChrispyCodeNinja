# Challenges using VSTS

## Poor UI

For almost everything I tried to do in VSTS, I had to do a Google search to find documentation.  It's completely non-intuitive and one of the worst possible user experiences.  Want to view epics, they are off by default and you'll have to go to the settings, into the Backlogs section, and enable them.  Want to move a story to a feature, you'll have to enable the Mapping option so that you can see the features to allow you to drag and drop.

## No Control Over Story Format
The user stories in VSTS are just text boxes, so if you want the standard "As a (persona) I want to (requirement) so that (business value)" you'll have to enter and enforce that manually.  That's pretty lame.  In addition, there's no place to setup your persona's or filter on them.  You'll have to add an extension that then sets them up as tags, so they will still not be a controlled part of your story definition.  Weak.
