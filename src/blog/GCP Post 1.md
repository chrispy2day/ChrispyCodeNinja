# Part 1: Intro and Setup

Back in November, I did a talk at a local .NET User Group about running .NET on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and always intended to leverage that as a series of videos.  Months later, I've finally had time to get around to it!  So here's the start to the series that will walk you through getting up and running on GCP as a .NET developer.

In this first video, I give an overview of what we'll be covering in this series as well as a brief background to Google's offering for .NET devs and a tour of their portal.

Next, I walk you through the setup to make sure you have everything you need to work effectively with GCP.

In the final video for this first post, I'll give you an overview of the app we will be working on throughout the series.  You can pull the source from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrispy2day/PicShare_GCPDemo).  Remember to checkout the GCP Compute tag, since that will give you the starting point and you can follow along.  If you run into issues, each step throughout the app transformation to a fully native cloud app has an intuitive tag so you can switch to the working code as needed.

In the next post I'll start off the journey of moving this app up to GCP.  Stay tuned!

In the meantime, happy coding!
