In this video tutorial, I walk you through doing a simple farm installation of SharePoint server.  The simple farm consists of one database server and one SharePoint server that hosts all the SharePoint roles. This is the smallest installation footprint that is appropriate for production use, but can easily be scaled out to a much larger installation. This is a great way to setup an environment for testing and development.
