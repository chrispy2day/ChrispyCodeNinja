# Part 2: Migration to GCE

In the last post ([Part 1: Intro and Setup](https://chrispycode.ninja/blog-article/gcp-dotnet-part1)), we learned about Google Cloud Platform and got our environment setup.  Now it is time to get our solution up into the cloud.  In this video, I'll use Google Compute Engine (GCE) to leverage Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to migrate our app to Google's platform.

You can follow along by pulling the code from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/chrispy2day/PicShare_GCPDemo).  Remember to checkout the code tagged with `GCP_Compute` to get the starting point of the code.  As the series progresses, you will then be able to follow along with the code changes.  If you run into any problems along the way, each step has an associated tag so it will be easy to checkout the working code.

In the next post, we'll start looking at how we can leverage Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings in GCP to take more advantage of the benefits of the cloud.  Stay tuned!

In the meantime, happy coding!
