Obviously, this just scratches the surface.  VSTS has a lot of features and customizations; it can support you from customizing your backlog all they way through to QA automation and setting up a full CI/CD pipeline.  Start learning more with the [VSTS New User Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/user-guide/).

Share what you have done in VSTS along with any challenges you are having, or have overcome, in the comments!

Happy Coding!
